Idris is a purely functional programming language, with first class types
- meaning that types are first class language constructs, and can be computed,
stored in variables, passed to and returned from functions, just like any
other first class construct. Even so, we still have to start with
"Hello world":

.. code-block:: idris

    main : IO ()
    main = putStrLn "Hello, Idris world"

A good place to start to find out what first class types mean in practice
is the (free) first chapter of
`Type Driven Development with Idris <https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris>`_.
Briefly, it means you can write functions to calculate types:

.. code-block:: idris

    IntOrString : (isInt : Bool) -> Type
    IntOrString True = Int
    IntOrString False = String

...and a function which calculates a type can itself be used in a type.
The following function either converts an ``Int`` to a ``String``, or
reverses the ``String``:

.. code-block:: idris

    showOrReverse : (isInt : Bool) -> IntOrString isInt -> String
    showOrReverse True x = show x
    showOrReverse False x = reverse x

Contrived as this may seem, this sort of mechanism allows us to give types
to ``printf``-like functions (full details omitted here, but you can
see it in the `tests <https://github.com/edwinb/Idris2/blob/master/tests/typedd-book/chapter06/Printf.idr>`_, where
the example is taken from the Type Driven Development book):

.. code-block:: idris

    printf : (format : String) -> PrintfType format

Idris data types are declared using a similar syntax to Haskell data types. For
example, natural numbers, an option type and lists are declared in the standard
library:

.. code-block:: idris

    data Nat     = Z       | S Nat
    data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
    data List a  = Nil     | (::) a (List a)

Functions are implemented by pattern matching. For example, addition on natural
numbers can be deﬁned as follows, again taken from the standard library:

.. code-block:: idris

    (+) : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    Z     + y = y
    (S k) + y = S (k + y)

Having types as a first class construct means that we can write functions
to compute types, as with ``printf`` above. Also, it means that we can
include *values* in types, to make those types more descriptive. A
*dependent type* is a type which is computed from, or depends on, another
value.

A classic introductory example of a dependent type is the type of vectors,
which are lists which carry their size in the type. They are declared as
follows in the standard library, by giving explicit types for each of the
constructors:

.. code-block:: idris

    data Vect : Nat -> Type -> Type where
        Nil  : Vect Z a
        (::) : a -> Vect k a -> Vect (S k) a

The types of functions defined over vectors will then state explicitly in
the type how the function affects the size of the vectors. For example,
if we append two vectors, the length of the result is the sum of the
lengths of the inputs:

.. code-block:: idris

    app : Vect n a -> Vect m a -> Vect (n + m) a
    app Nil       ys = ys
    app (x :: xs) ys = x :: app xs ys
