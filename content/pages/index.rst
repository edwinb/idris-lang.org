Idris is a programming language designed to encourage *Type-Driven
Development*.

In type-driven development, types are tools for constructing programs.  We
treat the type as the *plan* for a program, and use the compiler and type
checker as our assistant, guiding us to a complete program that satisfies the
type. The more expressive the type is that we give up front, the more
confidence we can have that the resulting program will be correct.

In Idris, types are first-class constructs in the language. This means types
can be passed as arguments to functions, and returned from functions just like
any other value, such as numbers, strings, or lists. This is a small but
powerful idea, enabling:

* relationships to be expressed between values; for example, that two lists
  have the same length.
* assumptions to be made explicit and checked by the compiler. For example, if
  you assume that a list is non-empty, Idris can ensure this assumption always
  holds before the program is run.
* if desired, properties of program behaviour to be formally stated and
  proven.

Getting Started
---------------

You can see some `small examples <{filename}./example.rst>`_, then take a
look at the `documentation <{filename}./docs/index.rst>`_.

Community
---------

**Mailing list**
    Long-form discussion happens on the `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/idris-lang>`_.
**GitHub**
    The Idris source is available from our repository.
    Tools and code by the wider Idris community are available in a 
    `GitHub organisation <https://github.com/idris-hackers>`_. 
**Discord**
    There is an Idris community on `Discord <https://discord.com/>`_ with
    several channels for learning, help and different aspects of development.
    You can `get an invitation to join here <https://discord.gg/YXmWC5yKYM>`_
    This is currently probably the most active place for interactive discussion
    of Idris.
**IRC**
    There is also an irc channel ``#idris`` on `libera <https://libera.chat/>`_.
    Point your irc client to ``irc.libera.chat`` then ``/join #idris``.
    For a web interface, you can try `IRCCloud <https://www.irccloud.com/>`_.
**Slack**
    There is an active ``#idris`` channel on the 
    `Functional Programming <https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/>`_ Slack.

All participants in these forums are requested to abide by the 
`community standards <{filename}./docs/standards.rst>`_.

Idris development is led by `Edwin Brady
<http://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/>`_
at the `School of Computer Science, University of St Andrews <http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk>`_.

Many thanks to Heath Johns for designing the logo.
